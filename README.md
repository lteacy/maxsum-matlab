maxsum-matlab
=============

This library provides a basic matlab implementation of the maxsum algorithm.

Getting Started
===============
Run the following at the matlab prompt:
maxSumHarness(2,2);

This will run the max-sum algorith on a acyclic factor graph of depth 2, with branching factor 2. This result is compared against the result of the standard max function applied to the sum of all the factors in the factor graph.

Known Issues
============
This code was originally part of a large library developed for personal use, so documentation is currently sparse in places. Also with hindsight, there are several changes that could be made to improve the performance and readability of the code. In particular, the msfun class, which represents discrete functions that may depend on overlapping sets of variables, is currently written using the old style for object oriented code in matlab. Updating this to the new style would streamline the code and make it more readable. There are also several changes that could be made to improve performance. For example, we currently overload some of the standard Matlab functions for cell arrays. Generally, overloading builtin functions for builtin types is not recommended by Mathworks, as it may impact on performance. In future versions, we may look into alternative strategies.

=================
We are currently working on a C++ implementation which can be found <a href="https://github.com/lteacy/maxsum-cpp">here.</a>
